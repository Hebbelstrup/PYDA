# PYDA
A dashboard for visualization and fitting of data obtained in the 'Protein Science' course.

## CD Plotter
Allows the user to upload files from the JASCO CD spectrometer. 
Will allow either the overlaying of multiple far-UV spectras or fitting of thermodynamic parameters of a single thermo or chemical denaturanation spectrum.
Is capable of normalization to mean residue ellipticity and filtering out saturations over 600.

## Ã„KTA PLOTTER
Allows for plotting of data from HPLC systems from Cytiva. 
Capable of overlaying multiple chromatograms and allows the user to filter out which data to display, such as conductivity, %B or fractions.
If multiple chromatograms are uploaded, only 280 nm will be shown.

## Flourescence plotter
Allows the PerkinElmer fluorescence Spectroscopy instruments.
Allows the fitting of one or multiple spectras.
If multiple are uploaded the user can select to display all curves at once. Additionally, the user can plot either the intensity at specific wavelength, selectable by a slider, or the wavelength with maximum intensity for all spectras.
Also allows for fitting of thermodynamic parameters.

## Files
A dipository for the files type which the above scripts were based on. Allows user to see which formats the Uniplotter will accept
